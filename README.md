# GeographicRealEstateAnalysis

1/2/2017 Update - I have found a program called RapidMiner and I'm looking at it and I think I'm going to try and utilize it for this project. It seems like a really strong tool that will be good for this task


#this is gonna be a long and somewhat drawn out project that I'm gonna update in a piecemeal fashion when I complete the sub functions necessary

#overall I want this code to go given 2 locations, compare a whole bunch of data points between them, both current and historic
#I came to this idea while wondering if the next gentrification hotspot in Philadelphia is going to be Camden, NJ, since it seems that Manayunk, fishtown, Northern Liberties and whatnot seem to be running the course a bit. The real estate value in Camden seems really depressed and the travel times to center city are actually lower than the more expensive real estate in south and north Philly. I am not going to ignore the quite high crime rates in Camden, but I seek to understand if the places currently being gentrified in philly had comparable crime rates to camden before the gentrification started at all

#so I want to go and get a bunch of current and historic data using web scrapers and whatnot, and then compare the trends between these locations all past and present to see if patterns that indicate a location is a prime candidate for gentrification

#sadly I'm not doing this to "protect" cities from gentrification, and instead I'm using it as in indication if someone should try and invest in a place BEFORE the giant wave of corporate gentrification comes in.
